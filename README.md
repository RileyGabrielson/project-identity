# Project Identity

A masterpiece of over-engineering, a symphony of type conversions, and a testament to the art of doing things the hard way.

## The Challenge

Build the most unnecessarily complex identity function possible. The goal is simple: take a number and return the exact same number.

## Constraints

- Input range: -1000 to 1000 (inclusive)
- Must return the exact same number that was input
- Must use as many unnecessary transformations as possible

## The Art of Over-Engineering

This project is a celebration of unnecessary complexity. Each module takes a simple task and transforms it into a journey through different data types and mathematical operations, all while maintaining the fundamental property of returning exactly what was given.

The beauty lies not in the result (which is, by definition, identical to the input), but in the creative and convoluted path we take to get there.
